# FFT vs DFT Comparison Project

This project aims to compare the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) in terms of execution time and the resulting frequency domain representation of audio signals.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
